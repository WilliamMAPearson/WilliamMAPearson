## About Me
I am currently the lead researcher and the head of the R+D department at an engineering consultancy based in Manchester. At this job I am currently developing new technology that will optimise physical assets against uncertain futures using probabilistic/Machine Learning models. I have a PhD in Materials for Demanding Environments from the University of Manchester. This repo serves as a personal repo for my personal projects including:

* XCT Segmentation using pre-trained ML model.
* Radon Transofmr and ML pipelien for detecting lines in noisy images.
* RMA Cathodic Reaction is an optimisation program for modelling corrosion.
* 3D2D Fractal Analysis for anlysing the three dimensional roughness of material captued with XCT.
